## VRO: Verifiable Routing Origins via AS Cooperations

### Project Introduction

The Internet faces significant challenges related to legitimate MOAS (Multiple-Origin Autonomous System) conflicts and route origin hijacking, which often exhibit similar patterns. VRO addresses these issues through a decentralized cooperative system among ASes (Autonomous Systems) to enhance routing security.

### Key Features

**Decentralized Cooperative System:** VRO enables cooperations among ASes to improve routing security.

**Allowlist Mechanism:** ASes collaboratively announce prefixes using aggregated signatures, forming a Signed MOAS Group (SMG).

**Blocklist Mechanism:** Neighboring ASes vote on the most credible AS based on local routing history in case of prefix conflicts using smart contracts.
